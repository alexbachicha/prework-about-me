      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a EEC Biologist and a Veterinary Technician. Coding and web development are new to me but I am excited to learn a new life skill.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Sacramento, CA</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Cooking, playing video games, gardening, yoga.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>To be satisfied with what I have, doing something I love. Really though, I would love to be swimming with sharks or getting paid to travel the world and try different foods.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Near the ocean, in the mountains or on a farm I own.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I'm not sure yet. I'm new to this field but I've always been interested in technology and how it's evolved over time. This bootcamp opportunity presented itself to me and I just couldn't resist. The world is becoming more technologically advanced and with it, new needs are arising. There is so much we don't know and have yet to discover and I want to be a part of that ingenuity.</p>
